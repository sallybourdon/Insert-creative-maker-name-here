# Welcome!
I feel like I need some sort of a catchy intro, but I'm at a loss so "welcome" is as good as it gets for now.


### Who am I?
I'm a multi-disciplinary scientist-- biology & food sustainability nerd and ecological economist-- working on creating a just present. In this present, we are building people-centered communities and economies that produce locally while connecting globally. I'm passiotnate about social, economic, and environmental justice(s) and I mainly pursue creating it through connecting with, educating on, and facilitating local food systems. This has been my calling since I can remember and it's integral to my personal life and professional career-- though the two tend to mix a lot. Other than that: I dance, hike, do collage, and play with my cats.

I am from Boston, Massachusetts (United States) but have been living in Spain since 2016. In the US, I graduated from Hamilton College with a dual masters in Biology and Hispanic Studies. While at university, I spent both academic and extracurricular time (separately) researching local food systems and sexual assault on college campuses and working in education around both topics. Following graduation, I continued variations of outreach and education around local food while interning at Slow Food USA's National School Garden Program while also working in marketing and events for a local hard cider company. But then I finally got my acceptance letter to teach English in Spain's public schools, and I picked up and moved to La Rioja (yes, I had to google where it was).
Soon after, I moved to Barcelona to do the same.
At the end of every school year, I thought I would be going back to the US but, without fail, I've found reasons to stay. Like my master's program at the UAB (2017-2018): I completed my masters in Interdisciplinary Studies in Social, Environmental and Economic Sustainability, specializing in Ecological Economics, and wrote my thesis on creating a tool to assess the use of therapeutic gardens on rooftops for the elderly. I then spent a year working for free on a variety of rooftop greenery related projects, nannying, and teaching more English before joining Fab Lab Barcelona in July 2019.

### Why am I here?
Months ago, a colleague of mine asked if I wanted to make a website and I roundly replied "no." To be incredibly frank, computers stress me out. I get confused easily and often and have very little patience for screens (I've spent quality time yelling at my computer to no avail). Learning something new on a computer, after working on a computer all day, was therefore the very last thing on my list of leisure activities, right after licking the sidewalk in Barceloneta.
However, since joining my teammates at Fab Lab Barcelona, I've been more motivated, especially after beginning to contribute to the Pop Machina Academy and seeing the Pop Machina Academy trainees progressing.
I want to use this page to share about my work, personal projects, passions, and interests. 

## Making this website: 
Welcome to my maker page, take 2.
So I tried to make a website. Correction: I am still trying to make a website. The first version looked like this (well, it will appear here once I figure out how to insert a screenshot). Basically, it's sad.
This is the second version. I tried to correct the first version over the span of hours to no avail and decided to start over from scratch.
Fingers crossed this uploads right.
